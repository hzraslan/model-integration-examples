## Small Language Model example
This example demonstrates how to use the Small Language Model to generate text. The Small Language Model is a pre-trained model that generates text based on the input text. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data and can generate text that is similar to the input text.
Libraries used:
- **Gradio** for the UI
- **Ollama** for pulling model from Hugging Face

To run this example, you need to install the following libraries:
- download ollama from [here](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
- pull required model from Hugging Face using ollama command
 example: ```ollama pull qwen2.5:0.5b```
 - install gradio using ```pip install gradio```
 - run the script using ```python main.py```
