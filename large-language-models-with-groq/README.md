Libraries used:
- **Gradio** for the UI
- **Groq** cloud API for pulling model

To run this example, you need to install the following libraries:
- go to groq console create an api key and inspect available models [here](https://console.groq.com/playground)
- install groq using ```pip install groq```
 - install gradio using ```pip install gradio```
